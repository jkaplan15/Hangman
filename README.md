Welcome to Flatiron Hangman! Join us while you take a break from your journey to becoming a full stack engineer! In this program you will be able to play a childhood favorite game without even leaving your terminal. 

Navigate to the Hangman directory and cd into 'db'. Then run <python Hangman.py> in your terminal.

You should now be prompted to enter a username (this is important because your username will hold your overall win / loss record so choose carefully). Once you enter your username press enter in your terminal. 

Now you can play hangman! If you aren't familiar; the idea is that a word is chosen at random and you have 6 guesses (you can guess letters or words) to find the word. After 6 incorrect guesses you will automatically lose and the database will be updated accordingly, but if you win... the database will also be updated accordingly. 

At the end of the game you will be asked if you wish to continue playing ('Y') or quit ('N'). Best of luck and happy coding!
